**The fourth internship task involved building a basic recommendation system that suggests items to a user based on other users' preferences. Initially, this was attempted using Apache Mahout, but due to complex dependencies and integration challenges, I implemented a simplified version using pure Java collections. The system takes a set of user-item ratings stored in nested HashMaps, calculates the total scores for items not yet rated by a target user, and recommends the highest-scoring ones. This logic mimics collaborative filtering, where recommendations are based on the similarity of user preferences. I implemented this project using JavaSE-22 in Eclipse. Although it was a manually coded algorithm, the task gave a strong foundation in the logic behind recommender systems used by platforms like Amazon and Netflix. It taught me how to analyze data patterns and make predictive suggestions. This project showcases how basic data science and user analytics concepts can be implemented using core programming principles before moving into machine learning libraries or frameworks.**
